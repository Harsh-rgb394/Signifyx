                    "Signifyx" is my project on which you can generate e-signatures or digital signatures with the help of two features. First, create by drawing the signature and be able to change the color of the signature and download it. The second feature allows you to create a signature with the help of generated fonts, so you donâ€™t need to manually create the signature. Just select the font you prefer or like, and you have options like changing the slant nature with some italic forms, and you can also change the color of the generated signature.
